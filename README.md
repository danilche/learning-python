My Python learning journey

Hi, my name is Dane. This is my first contact with git and this repository was created with my training assignments while learning Python
using "Python Programming - An Introduction To Computer Science" by John M. Zelle in mind. I did not organize files by chapters so it
might look messy but then again, this is training only. Hopefully, I will be ashamed of the uglyness of this code one day :)
